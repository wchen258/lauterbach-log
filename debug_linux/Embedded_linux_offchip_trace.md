Lauterbach dedicates a [document specifically for this purpose](https://www2.lauterbach.com/pdf/app_xilinx_zynq.pdf). In this documentation, multiple methods are described to achieve the offchip trace. The trace information can be exported either through MIO pin (does not involve PL) or through EMIO (through PL). As for my current understanding, the first method encountered some error I detailed [here](https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Processor-System-Design-and-AXI/Error-while-changing-MIO-assignment-to-I2C-and-cannot-find-DGB/td-p/1223119). \

The second approach successfully established the offchip trace. However, I did not follow the instructions on the Lauterbach document, but implemented a [design provided by Xilinx](https://www.xilinx.com/support/answers/66669.html). If the onchip trace works correctly, then after implementing this hardware design, the offchip trace should be ready to use directly.
